## About

Winter is an anarchy forge mod that serves as a utility client, designed to enhance your Minecraft experience. 

## Why?

We're releasing Winter because, over time, sqlskid and I have shifted our focus to other projects. As a result, we're no longer actively maintaining this client.

## Download

Get the latest Winter jar [here](path/to/download/jar).

## Build Instructions

To build Winter using Gradle, follow these simple steps:

For Windows users:

```
gradlew build
```

For Unix users:
```
./gradlew build
```

## Further Development

Our Winter client has served as a foundation for other projects, such as the private and actively maintained client Demonware. Developed by [PotatoSUS](https://github.com/PotatoSUS) and [JohnShiozo](https://github.com/JohnShiozo), Demonware leverages the core features of Winter while adding their own unique enhancements and improvements.
