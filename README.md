## About

Winter is an anarchy forge mod that serves as a utility client, designed to enhance your Minecraft experience. The project is now publicly available due to being old and not maintained anymore. Both [sqlskid](https://github.com/sqlskid) and [virtualbox](https://github.com/sqlskid) have moved on to other projects, but we wanted to share our work with the community.
